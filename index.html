    <h2>Unique Pets</h2>

    <h3>Milo</h3>
    <p>Milo, a bashful yet warm-hearted dog, holds a deep appreciation for social interactions, whether they involve humans or fellow pets. Having spent his entire life with the same loving family, Milo's consistent displays of loyalty reflect his strong sense of familiarity and connection. He's known for his charming quirks, such as his penchant for taking a few steps backward instead of a simple turn when changing direction.
    </p>
    <p>Despite his shyness, Milo's keen senses come to the forefront. At the sound of a passing car, his bark, though more bark than bite, resonates beyond the walls of the house. Interestingly, Milo has never quite grasped the concept of navigating stairs, yet he remains remarkably perceptive about his surroundings. It's this unique blend of traits that makes Milo an endearing presence, leaving a lasting impression on those fortunate enough to share in his companionship.

    <h3>Cheeto (Chicken)</h3>
    <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. 
    </p>
    <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

    <h3>Chief</h3>
    <p>Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try to consume geese poop.
    </p>
    <p>He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.

    <img src="images/riley_primary.jpg" alt="Apricot goldendoodle wearing blue bandana lying next to ball">
    <h3>Riley</h3>
    <p>Riley is a 2yr old goldendoodle. He is very active and loves attention. Riley can be pretty mischievous; as such, his favorite activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on a cool floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk in his local park or hang out with his best friend Cosmo. 
    </p>
    <p>Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and pampered. He’s currently in his “terrible twos,” and must get everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a perfect, funny, and loyal dog.

    <img src="images/carlos.jpg" alt="Blue parakeet crouching about to fly">
    <h3>Carlos</h3>
    <p>Carlos is a blue parakeet/budgerigar that my older sister adopted from her friend in high school. Carlos is 9 years old and loves flying around the kitchen and standing on chandeliers. She has very loud chirps and loves to chatter when people play instruments. Although she can be aggressive at times and is very unfriendly towards strangers, she has a very soft bite.
    </p>
    <p>Carlos has a sister named Einstein. We did not discover the genders of our pet birds until years after we named them. At night, Carlos always sleeps on her favorite yellow swing and will wake up in the same spot every morning in the upstairs of her cage ready to come out and play.
